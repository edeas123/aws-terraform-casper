You can contribute in the following ways:

1. Fix coverage of a particular resource. For example, are there other ways an aws instance can be created directly or indirectly in terraform. Currently we support instances created through `aws_spot_instance` and `aws_instance`.

2. Support coverage for other services. Currently we support EC2, IAM, S3. Extending to support other services is straightforward.

3. Support other resources within a service. Do you think an important service resource is not supported? You can contribute code to support that resource.

4. More detailed documentations on how to contribute, for example how to add a new service.


Any other forms of contribution is also appreciated.
